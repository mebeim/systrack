**See [mebeim/linux-syscalls](https://github.com/mebeim/linux-syscalls) for live syscall tables powered by Systrack**.

Systrack is a tool to analyze Linux kernel images (`vmlinux`) and extract
information about implemented syscalls. Given a `vmlinux` image, Systrack can
extract syscall numbers, names, symbol names, definition locations within kernel
sources, function signatures, and more.

Systrack can configure and build kernels for all its
[supported architectures](#supported-architectures-and-abis), and works best at
analyzing kernels that it has configured and built by itself.


Installation
------------

Systrack is [available on PyPI][pypi-systrack], it requires Python 3.8+ and is
installable through Pip:

```bash
pip install systrack
```

Building and installaing from source requires [`hatch`][pypi-hatch]:

```bash
hatch build
pip install dist/systrack-XXX.whl
```

Usage
-----

Systrack can mainly be used for two purposes: analyzing or building Linux
kernels. See also [Command line help](#command-line-help) (`systrack --help`)
and [Supported architectures and ABIs](#supported-architectures-and-abis)
(`systrack --arch help`) below.

- **Analyzing** a kernel image can be done given a `vmlinux` ELF with symbols,
  and optionally also a kernel source directory (`--kdir`). Systrack will
  extract information about implemented syscalls from the symbol table present
  in the given `vmlinux` ELF, and if debugging information is present, it will
  also extract file and line number information for syscall definitions.
  Supplying a `--kdir` pointing Systrack to the checked-out sources for the
  right kernel version (the same as the one to analyze) will help refine and/or
  correct the location of the definitions.

  Systrack can guess the architecture and ABI to analyze, but if the given
  kernel was built with support for multiple ABIs, the right one can be selected
  through `--arch`.

  ```none
  systrack path/to/vmlinux
  systrack --format json path/to/vmlinux
  systrack --format html path/to/vmlinux
  systrack --kdir path/to/linux_git_repo path/to/vmlinux
  systrack --kdir path/to/linux_git_repo --arch x86-64-ia32 path/to/vmlinux
  ```

- **Building** can be done through the `--build` option. You will need to
  provide a kernel source directory (`--kdir`) and an architecture/ABI
  combination to build for (`--arch`).

  ```none
  systrack --build --kdir path/to/linux_source_dir --arch x86-64
  ```

  When building, kernel sources are configured to enable all syscalls available
  for the selected architecture/ABI as to produce a `vmlinux` with a "complete"
  syscall table.

  Cross-compilation with GCC is possible specifying the correct toolchain prefix
  with the `--cross` option, which will set the `CROSS_COMPILE` variable for the
  kernel's `Makefile`. Other environment variables can also be used as usual and
  are passed as is to `make`, so LLVM [cross]-compilation and custom toolchain
  usage is also possible.

  ```none
  systrack --build --kdir path/to/linux_source --arch arm64 --cross aarch64-linux-gnu-
  ```

Notes:

1. Building creates a kernel supporting all ABIs for this architecture.
2. Build based on `defconfig` for Linux <= v3.7.
3. Build based on `rv32_defconfig` for Linux <= v6.7 and `defconfig` for
   Linux <= v5.0.
4. Building creates an EABI kernel with compat OABI support. Building an
   OABI-only kernel is NOT supported. The seccomp filter system will be missing.
5. "SPU" is not a real ABI. It indicates a Cell processor SPU (Synergistic
   Processing Unit). The ABI is really PPC64, but SPUs can only use a subset of
   syscalls.
6. "RV32" and "RV64" are not real ABIs, but rather ISAs. The RISC-V syscall
   ABI is the same for 32-bit and 64-bit (only register size differs). These
   names are only used for clarity.

Runtime dependencies
--------------------

External (non-Python) runtime dependencies are:

- **Required**: `readelf` (from GNU binutils) is used to parse and extract ELF
  metadata such as symbols and sections. This is currently the only *compulsory*
  external dependency of Systrack.
- Optional: `addr2line` (from GNU binutils) is used to extract location
  information from DWARF debug info. Without this program, Systrack will not
  output any information about syscall definition locations.
- Optional: `rg` ([ripgrep][ripgrep]) is used for much faster recursive
  grepping of syscall definition locations within kernel sources when needed.
  Otherwise, a slower pure-Python implementation is used.
- Optional: a working compiler toolchain and
  [kernel build dependencies](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/changes.html)
  are obviously needed if you want Systrack to *build* kernels from source.


Limitations
-----------

- Supported kernel images: Systrack works with regular *uncompressed* `vmlinux`
  ELF images and *needs* ELF symbols. Compressed and stripped kernel images are
  not supported. Tools such as
  [`vmlinux-to-elf`](https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf) can be used to
  uncompress and unstrip kernel images, after which Systrack will be able to
  analyze them.
- Old kernel versions: Systrack was mainly designed for and tested on modern
  kernels (>= v4.0) and has not been tested on older kernels. It should still
  *somewhat* work on older kernels, but without the same level of guarantee on
  the correctness of the output. Support for old kernels may come gradually in
  the future.
- Relocatable kernels: Systrack does not currently parse and apply ELF
  relocations. This means that Systrack does not support kernels using
  relocation entries for the syscall table. On some architectures (notably MIPS)
  if the kernel is relocatable the syscall table is relocated at startup and
  does not contain valid virtual addresses: Systrack will currently fail to
  analyze such kernels.
- Building kernels: when building kernels for you, Systrack does not try too
  hard to build usable or sane kernel images. Builds are usually based on
  defconfig plus Kconfig tweaks to enable all possible syscalls, which is the
  main goal. Some unneeded features are disabled at build time (e.g., USB
  support). Therefore, please *do not run kernels built with Systrack.*
